## How to Access and Run Each Question  

This repository contains both **PDF explanations** and **Python implementations** for each question. Follow the instructions below to access and run the solutions.  

### **Step 1: Access the PDF Solutions**  
Each question has a detailed step-by-step explanation stored in the `reports/` folder.  

- **Question 1 PDF:** [`reports/question_1.pdf`](reports/_CO5241_Question_1.pdf)   

### ** Step 2: Run the Python Code**  
The Python scripts for each question are located inside the `solutions/` directory.  

#### **1 Running Python Scripts Locally**  
Make sure you have **Python 3** installed. Then, follow these steps:  
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the `solutions/` directory using the `cd` command.
3. Run the Python script using the `python` command followed by the script name (e.g., `python question_1.py`). python solutions/question_1.py
4. The script will execute and display the results.
